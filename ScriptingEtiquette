Scripting Etiquette
As many different team members will be working with, on, or reviewing the various scripts that are created in order to bring functionality to the game, we need to adhere to a strict etiquette when it comes to writing our scripts. Any one member of the team should be able to review a script, understand its functionality, and know who to contact regarding any questions related to said script. Proper notation and uniformed formatting are necessary to accomplish this.
Each script will start with the following Header:
/*
* AUTHOR:
* REFERENCES:
* NOTES:
* TODO: [Planned improvements]
* FIXME: [Known bugs or issues]
*/
The Body of the script will be broken up into the following regions:
#region Vars will contain the variables for the script. They should be arranged by Configuration Parameters, States, and Cached References. Headers should be utilized to maintain organization within the Unity Inspector. Tooltips should be included as necessary.
#region StandardFunctions will contain functions related to Unity standard operations such as Awake, Start, Update, etc.
#region HelperFunctions will contain functions that are only called from within the current script to manage and update relevant data.
#region AccessorFunctions will contain functions that are called from other scripts to access information contained within the current script.
#region MutatorFunctions will contain functions that are called from other scripts to alter data contained within the current script.
An example script is as follows:
